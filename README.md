<br>If you choose to interact using speech, you can record your responses by clicking on the microphone under the question. If you answered the question, click on the microphone again to stop recording. Your response will appear in text under the question, and if you're satisfied, you can submit your response. Once you've submitted your response, a next question will appear. AI business advice will be generated once you've answered all questions. You can always record new responses if needed.
