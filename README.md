## Description

This Streamlit mini-app generates sound business advice using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for chat completion and whisper-1 for speech-to-text conversion.

You have two options to interact with the services, either using text, or using speech.

If you choose to interact using text, you can fill in the text area to provide a clear description of your specific business, and then hit ctrl + enter to send in your response. If you're on mobile, you should simply leave the text area.

If you choose to interact using speech, you can record your responses by clicking on the coffee mugs under each question. If you answered the question, click on the coffee mug again to stop recording and submit your response. Once you've submitted responses for all questions, advice will be generated.
